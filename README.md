# Modeler-Star-Chick

Made in Visual Studio 2015
This was made for a Graphics class

Requirements:
- Make a 3D model consisting of primitive shapes such as box, generalized cylinder, sphere, and triangle. Use at least 10 primitive
shapes and have a four level hierarchy. Use  glTranslate(), glRotate() and glScale() at least once to shape the primitives in the 
space. Also use glPushMatrix() and glPopMatrix() for matrix transformation.
- Create sliders for your model for different features such as moving a joint/component or to perform an action.
- Replace the gluLookat() function in Camera class with your own Lookat() function using standard transformations and/or matrix 
construction
- Make a gif of your 3D model doing an "animation" or action

The only files I worked on for this project were sample.cpp (used for testing openGL), ship.cpp, camera.cpp, camera.h and 
modelerglobals.h to add colors and sliders.

Star_Chick is a screenshot of the 3D model made for this project. 
Try_Fly.gif is the animation of the model performing actions made with the sliders.
save.bmp is a screenshot of the sample model made.
